# Healthcare Codeset API

## Purpose
To make codesets (ex: HCPCS, NDC) easily accessible for companies/projects. 

## Background
I want to make an easy to use frontend and api for healthcare codesets so
that people can easily make projects or improvie their existing ones. 

I do not work on this full time so it will not always be up to date. 
The updates to the codesets are made by either cron jobs (depending on when the
codesets are released) or via manual updates which I do w/ my free time. 

Thanks!
