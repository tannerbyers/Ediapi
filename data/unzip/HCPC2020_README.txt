Alpha-Numeric HCPCS File Content

This file contains the Level II Alpha-numeric HCPCS procedure and modifier codes, their long and short descriptions, and applicable Medicare administrative, 
coverage, and pricing data.  The Level II HCPCS codes, which are established by CMS's Alpha-Numeric Editorial Panel, primarily represent items and supplies and 
non-physician services not covered by the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology-4 (CPT-4) codes; Medicare, Medicaid, and private health 
insurers use HCPCS procedure and modifier codes for claims processing.  Level II alphanumeric procedure and modifier codes comprise the A to V range. 

The alpha-numeric HCPCS is provided in a self-extracting, compressed file.  When decompressed, the executable will explode into the following files:  

1.)	HCPCREAD.TXT, a read me file that contains general information about the alpha-numeric HCPCS file; 

2.)	HCPC2020_CONTR_ANWEB.TXT and HCPC2020_CONTR_ANWEB.XLS, the 2020 alpha-numeric HCPCS file.  


The Alpha-numeric Index and Table of Drugs will be available for download separately at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets/Alpha-Numeric-HCPCS.html.



HCPCS Update Schedule

With the exception of temporary codes, Level II alphanumeric procedure and modifier codes are updated annually on January 1.  Temporary codes, which begin with 
G, K, or Q, are updated on a flow basis throughout the year.  Nevertheless, the alphanumeric HCPCS file will only be uploaded to the CMS web site on an annual basis. 
As a result, temporary coding changes or Medicare administrative, coverage, or pricing data changes that occur outside of the annual update process may not be reflected 
in the file.  In most cases, these temporary coding changes are noted in Program Memoranda (PM) to Medicare carriers and fiscal intermediaries.
