Note regarding coverage and payment indicators for codes in CMS’ 2020 HCPCS Update and DMEPOS Fee Schedule Files

If specific Medicare coverage or payment indicators or values have not been established for any new HCPCS codes, this may be 
because a national Medicare coverage determination and/or fee schedule amounts have not yet been established for these items.  
This is neither an indicator of Medicare coverage or non-coverage.  In these cases, until national Medicare coverage and payment 
guidelines have been established for these codes, the Medicare coverage and payment determinations for these items may be made 
based on the discretion of the Medicare contractors processing claims for these items.
